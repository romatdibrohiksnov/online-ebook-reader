A browser-based ebook reader with an emphasis on a clean reading experience. 

## Features

* Decent typography – like a reader mode for ebooks.
* Remembers your last location in the book.
* Private – your books and reading history are stored locally in your browser cache, no other tracking.
* Optimised for mobile.
* Dark mode.

**Limitations:**
* Only works with DRM-free epubs.
* Doesn't work well with ebooks where every page is an image.

Built with Vue and epub.js.
